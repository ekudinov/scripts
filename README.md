My scripts to make some things for me


1.trans.sh - script to translate text from english language to russian. 
My very old script.

Script must use utils: zenity, grep, wget, xclip
* get from yandex token key to access
* set lang to translate from "translate" variable
* set trans.sh to PATH env
* set keyboard keys to invoke trans.sh

For example for xubuntu:
keys Win+Y invoke $HOME/.local/bin/trans.sh after selection text to translate
